Here the latest versions of the files we want to test are added so that they can be synthesized together.
When putting together a new version, a new folder must be created here with a unique name for those versions of the files to be put in.
suggested naming scheme: 
- Folder names go from A-Z, and are a reference to tools. e.x first would Abacus, then Bearing etc..
